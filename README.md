# Drops-of-Hope-Game-
Drops of Hope is a simple browser-based game that raises awareness about the global water crisis. The player collects clean water drops while avoiding bacteria and waste. The goal is to fill the jerry can with enough clean water before time runs out.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML5 Canvas is used to draw the game elements such as water drops, bacteria, and the jerry can.

CSS3 provides styling, layout, and responsive design for the game screen and menus.

JavaScript handles the game logic, including:

Spawning and animating objects (water, bacteria, waste)

Collision detection between the player and objects

Score tracking and milestone messages

Timer and difficulty settings

Sound effects and win/lose conditions

Event Listeners capture user input for controlling the player and restarting the game.

Randomization is used to place objects at different positions for replayability.
